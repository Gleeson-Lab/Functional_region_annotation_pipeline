# Functional_region_annotation_pipeline
## Overview
An extension of existing variant annotation pipeline which adds extra functional scores and region-based annotations. The objective of the development of this improved variant annotation pipeline is to gather as much information about the variant input as possible by pure bioinformatic methods. As a result, more informed and educated interpretations and decisions on genome variants can be made before moving onto the subsequent variant validation experiments and in vitro/in vivo functionals studies of the variants.
